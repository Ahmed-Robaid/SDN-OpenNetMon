SDN-OpenNetMon
==============

OpenNetMon offers and accurate and precise OpenFlow Monitoring POX module.
Its key contribution is to monitor not only throughput, but also per flow packet loss and path delay for all flows and paths in use in an OpenFlow network.
The output is currently printed to terminal and saved to two files, but is intended to be used as input for QoS controllers.

When using OpenNetMon please refer to the accompanying article: Niels L. M. van Adrichem, Christian Doerr and Fernando A. Kuipers, 2014, OpenNetMon: Network monitoring in OpenFlow Software-Defined Networks, IEEE/IFIP Network Operations and Management Symposium (NOMS), Poland, Krak√≥w, May 5-9, http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6838228

Installation:
Installation is easy :-) (who would not say so)
Step 1)
Decide whether you want to go with a physical testbed or use Mininet and install accordingly.

Step 2)
Install POX (betta branch) on your controller node according to: https://openflow.stanford.edu/display/ONL/POX+Wiki#POXWiki-InstallingPOX

Step 3)
You should now have a folder ~/pox containing the working directory of pox.
In the pox working directory is a folder `ext`, meant to contain files that should not be modified by upgrading POX or checking out another brance.

Create a new folder `opennetmon`  into the `ext` directory and clone and extract the code into it.

# mkdir ~/pox/ext/opennetmon
# git clone https://github.com/TUDelftNAS/SDN-OpenNetMon ~/pox/ext/opennetmon

CD into the POX working directory
# cd ~/pox

Run POX with the OpenNetMon modules
# ./pox.py opennetmon.startup

From here on, you are good to go to run experiments and get a feeling of OpenNetMon's capabilities.
The OpenNetMon module contains a forwarding module capable of finding shortest paths in multipath networks and starts all depending modules from the `opennetmon/startup.py` script.
